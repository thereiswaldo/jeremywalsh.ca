A friend was wondering how to pace themselves at the Around the Bay 30km road race on March 27th. The race has a unique elevation profile of several significant hills in the last 10km.

 For a runner hoping to meet a specific time it begs the question of whether they should start the race faster than their goal race pace, anticipating slowing down on the hills near the end of the race. Conventional running wisdom is to run "even splits", which is running the same pace for the entirety of a race.  I want to look at what is optimal for the Around the Bay course. 

## Pacing Heuristics

The simplests of the pacing heuristics are even pace, and even effort. Even pacing simple means to run the same pace through the whole race. It's a good strategy for a flat course, but can be near impossible to replicate on a hilly course. The solution is then to switch to an even effort, where a exertion is kept constant, and pace is slowed on uphills and increased on downhills. This is a good simple heuristic, but can be difficult to follow in a race. Unless one is diligently heart rate training, it's difficult to start and maintain a heart rate throughout a race.

At a slightly higher complexity level are the rules developed from two of the most infamous studies on the subject.
