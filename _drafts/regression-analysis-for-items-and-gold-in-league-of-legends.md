Continuing my analysis on League of Legends ([first post here](http://jeremywalsh.ca/2021/04/15/league-of-legends-analyzing-champion-basic-stats.html)), I want to talk about items in the game. As a new player one of the things that I feel isn't well communicated is the importance of getting gold to build items. 

As a player you gain gold for killing enemy creeps, champions, buildings, or neutral monsters. There is also a mechanism for passive gold generation and assisting in kills.
