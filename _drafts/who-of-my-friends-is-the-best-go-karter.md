* who is the fastest
  * what data do we have?
    * 4 races on paper
      * show paper picture
      * converted to tables
      * missing kart numbers and 3 race sheets
    * asked for kart numbers and missing races
      * added those and kart numbers
  * who scored the most points
    * mario kart scoring, f1 scoring
    * fastest laps
    * fastest lap average or scoring
    * but karts were different
  * we felt there was a fast kart, are some karts faster than others
    * fastest lap
      * my karts were the 4 fastest karts, was that lucky chance by me or did i influence that
    * free and clear laps? 
      * assume for now that fastest lap is good enough proxy for this
  * who was fastest
* who drove the most defensively (pat?)
  * ability to keep other drivers behind, particularly if they are fast drivers with good karts
* classify each driver as one from mario kart given driving style
