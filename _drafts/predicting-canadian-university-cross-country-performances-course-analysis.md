Before we can do detailed predictions for cross country races we need to build a dataset. This dataset is going to be primarily filled with the race results, but we also want to add other exogenous features to improve the accuracy of our model. This is because, as anyone who has run a race before could tell you, your name and the race distance alone aren't enough to accurately predict your finish time. Other factors like the weather and the time in season play a large impact on an individuals finish time. For this post I want to develop one such exogenous feature that I think will play a large roll in our model, the race course.
