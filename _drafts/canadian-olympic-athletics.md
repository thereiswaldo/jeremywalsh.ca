Canada won 24 medals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games, with 6 coming from Athletics. The 6 medals equals the total medals from the Athletics team in 2016, and considering the two golds vs 2016's single gold medal, is the best performance from Canadian Athletics since the 1932 Los Angeles games. The 6 medals put Canadian Athletics in [8th place](https://www.worldathletics.org/competitions/olympic-games/the-xxxii-olympic-games-athletics-7132391/medaltable), while the team's 15 top-8 placings put [Canada in 5th place,](https://www.worldathletics.org/competitions/olympic-games/the-xxxii-olympic-games-athletics-7132391/placingtable) the best in modern games history. With such an impressive team performance, I wanted to highlight the medal winners

### 4x100m Bronze

The team of Aaron Brown, Jerome Blake, Brendon Rodney, and Andre de Grasse brought home the final olympic medal of the athletics campaign with a bronze. The time of 37.70 is the [3rd best all time](https://athletics.ca/rankings-records/rankings/?y=0&season=Outdoor&area=National&age_group_id=&category=Relays&event_id=136&track_wind=No&best_by_athlete=Yes) from a Canadian team, only behind the bronze medal performance in the Rio 2016 games and the gold from the Atlanta 1996 games.

The silver medal winning Great Britain's time is the fastest silver medal in Olympic history pointing to not just to the progression of the sprint times, but the depth of competition in the event.

![Olympic 4X100m Medal Winning Times Scatter Plot](/uploads/olympic-4x100m-medal-winning-times.png "Olympic 4X100m Medal Winning Times")

With the potential of [Great Britain's silver medal winning team being disqualified](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/trackandfield/chinjindu-ujah-tests-positive-4-100m-tokyo-olympics-1.6138959), there is potential for Canada getting upgraded to silver.

### Andre De Grasse Trifecta

Andre De Grasse cemented himself as a superhuman sprinter and one of the greatest olympians in Canadian history. His three medals in Tokyo 2020 to match his three from Rio 2016 put him in some illustrious company.![Top Canadian Olympic Medalists By Medal](/uploads/top-canadian-olympic-medalists.png "Top Canadian Olympic Medalists")

With Penny Oleksiak and Andre De Grasse likely competing again in three years at the 2024, there is the potential for the top end of this graph to change again soon.

##### 100m

Andre's 100m bronze medal keeps Canada as the country with the [4th most medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_at_the_Olympics#Medals_by_country) in the event. It is Canada's 7th medal in the event, the most successful athletics event for Canada all time.
