Canada won 24 medals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games, with 6 coming from Athletics. The 6 medals equals the total medals from the Athletics team in 2016, and considering the two golds vs 2016's single gold medal, is the best performance from Canadian Athletics since the 1932 Los Angeles games. The 6 medals put Canadian Athletics in [8th place](https://www.worldathletics.org/competitions/olympic-games/the-xxxii-olympic-games-athletics-7132391/medaltable), while the team's 15 top-8 placings put [Canada in 5th place,](https://www.worldathletics.org/competitions/olympic-games/the-xxxii-olympic-games-athletics-7132391/placingtable) the best in modern games history. With such an impressive team performance, I wanted to highlight the medal winners
